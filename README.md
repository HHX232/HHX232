## 💼 What I Do Best

### 🌐 **International E-commerce & Marketplaces**
I build full-featured, multilingual online stores and marketplaces from the ground up. My experience covers:

- **Integration with payment gateways** (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) and logistics APIs.

### ⚙️ **Technical Excellence & Performance**
I don't just write code — I craft solutions that are:
- **Blazing fast** (optimizing Core Web Vitals is my routine).
- **SEO-optimized** with semantic markup, microdata (Schema.org), and server-side rendering.
- **Pixel-perfect** and fully responsive across all devices.
- **Accessible** (a11y) and user-friendly.
